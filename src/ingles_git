Whats is Git and Github?

	GIT is a version system. Basically, it works with versions of a project, your project.
You'll control the changes in your project, generating new versions called "commits".

	Always when you start a project, or clone from Github and modifying it, you make an evolution in your project, and this
evolution must be "commited" for you can update your project to a new version.

	The better of all of it, is the if a new version cause problems in the project, you can undo the last "commmit",
realizing a "Rollback" on your project. This is because the project on GIT are in a version repository.

	Your project, as well as its versions, are saved in a remote repository (server). So, you can make changes to the project in your
machine (local repository), generate a new "commit" and save the changes on the server again.



***********************
Here comes the Github!!

	The Github is a service for hosting remote GIT repositories.

 	It is accessed by GIT installed on your machine, which saves your projects in the repositories on Github.
	With this you will always have your project saved outside the local machine.
